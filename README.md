# Lateral_Movement_Toolkit
coded By Pakistani ethical HAcker mr sabaz ali khan

Notes:

The functions (smb_scan, dump_credentials, privilege_escalation) are placeholders. You can extend them with actual lateral movement techniques using libraries like impacket for SMB, or custom scripts for credential dumping and privilege escalation.
The banner uses the "slant" font from pyfiglet for a stylish look. You can change the font by modifying the font parameter in pyfiglet.figlet_format().
The script includes basic error handling and command-line argument parsing for ease of use.
